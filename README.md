### 👋 About Me
I am a Computer Science student at **UT Austin** with a dual focus on **Cloud-Native Web Development** and **Low-Level Systems**. I build scalable applications using AWS and Next.js, but I’m equally comfortable managing memory and optimizing processor pipelines in C.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

| Domain | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C, SQL |
| **Frontend** | React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, HTML5/CSS3 |

### 🚀 Featured Projects

**🏠 [Enterprise Real Estate Platform](https://github.com/Austinr-12/client)**
*Next.js, AWS (Cognito, RDS, S3), TypeScript, PostgreSQL*
> A scalable rental platform supporting 100+ concurrent users. Features geospatial property search (PostGIS) and secure multi-factor authentication via AWS Cognito.

**⚙️ [ARM CPU Emulator]**
*C, Assembly, Systems Programming*
> A 5-stage pipelined processor emulator. I designed a custom hazard detection unit that resolved data dependencies, improving instruction throughput by **40%**.

**📦 [Huffman Compression Tool]**
*Java, Data Structures & Algorithms*
> A file compression system using binary heaps and bit-level I/O. Achieved a **37.6% compression ratio** on large text corpora, reducing file sizes by nearly 60%.

### 🤝 Community & Leadership
* **Member:** Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists (HACS)
* **Focus:** Mentorship, technical workshops, and professional development in tech.
